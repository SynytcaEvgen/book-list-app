# Test task

## Scenario & Requirements

Create a reusable React component that displays a list of books. Each
item should have:

A title: Displayed prominently.

A description: Shown below the title.

An optional image: Displayed alongside the title and description
(consider providing a placeholder image URL if no image is provided).

A toggle: Allows the user to show/hide the description.

A new item button: On click adds a new book and causes an
automatic update of the list

There is no need to consider persisted storage for this scenario, use of a
pre-populated mocked data model in memory is sufficient.

We should be able to run the solution to see the component in action.

Component Reusability: The component should accept the title,
description, and image URL as props. It should handle cases where the
description or image URL are missing.

State Management: The component should use React state to manage
the visibility of the description.

JSX and Styling: The component should use JSX for rendering and
basic CSS (inline or a simple stylesheet) for styling. Avoid overly
complex styling.

Error Handling: The component should gracefully handle potential
errors, such as an invalid image URL. A simple placeholder message
would suffice.

Testing: Request a simple test (e.g., using Jest or React Testing
Library) to cover at least one aspect of the component's functionality.

## Non-Functional Requirements

There’s only 1 explicit non-functional requirement:

Structure your code using modern development
practices, the type you’d be proud to see in
production

Consider accessibility standards (WCAG)
